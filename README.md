## Notes
1. Update the GPIO pin config in the header file `src/epdif.h`.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE installed
- ESP32 board support added to Arduino IDE
- Required libraries: `SPI`, `Wire`, `WiFi`, `NTPClient`, `Preferences`, `BH1750`, `RTClib`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KamadoTanjiro-beep/E-Paper-Display-NTP-Clock.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Update the WiFi credentials in the `epdNtpClockV1.ino` file:
   ```cpp
   const char *ssid = "Your_SSID";
   const char *password = "Your_PASSWORD";
   ```
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Upcoming Features
Check [issues](https://github.com/KamadoTanjiro-beep/E-Paper-Display-NTP-Clock/issues).

Clock based on Waveshare 3.52inch e-Paper HAT, 360 Ã— 240. :leaves: Eco-Friendly!

The clock runs on a 6000mAh LiFePO4 cell (:leaves: :leaves: Eco-Friendly!). It uses an RTC for power-saving operation and connects to NTP daily to update itself.

It also includes a LUX sensor (BH1750) for sleeping while it is dark (E-paper doesn't have a backlight). (:leaves: :leaves: :leaves: Eco-Friendly!)

Made of old delivery cardboards. :exploding_head: One-Punch Eco-Friendly Boost Ultra Pro Max :leaves: to :infinity:

Supports 5V 1A charging with options up to 2A.

All USB-C operation (charging and debugging).

This clock does not run on the GxEPD2 Library (the display was not supported at the time of making). It uses the OEM-provided basic library.

Battery life:
- Full: 06/06/2024
- Dead: 01/11/2024 (Around 4 months and 27 days)
